### <7/May>
#### Summary
> What work did you do this week
- During the class, our team(Team facilitate) has had a chat for how to improve ocr visually and functionally for visual impairment people who need a code script from video. 
- Looked into Tesseract OCR to see how it works and how convenient to control the Tesseract for visual impairment people.
- Considered which way of improvements are more helpful for visual impairment people in either faster processing in scanning, scripting, and formatting code snippet or better accessibility in UI/UX.
- Looked into a research document focused on the performance of OCR depending on varying video quality and large language models.
>What work you are planning to do next week
- Still need to find out more discomfort of visual impairment people (I don't think we are fully understanding how difficult those people would be handling the Tesseract OCR)

> Any blockers
- Getting OpenAI API
